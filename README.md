# Assignment 1: Protests
The past few years in the United States, there has been a surge in protests in support of Black Lives Matter, gender equity, and other social issues. 
## Background Research 
- Protests may be benefitting from a country that is more conditioned to protesting from the adversarial stance that the Trump administration has taken on issues like guns, climate change, and immigration. The BLM movement [became the largest movement in US history](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html) increase support from people who had never been involved in a form of activism or demonstration and had seen information about violence against the Black community.

- Structural racism fortifies and informs policies in the US that perpetuate racial disparities in health outcomes, inequalities in health determinants, such as housing, education and healthcare, as well as through the discriminatory policing of African Americans. Protests are aimed to draw attention to the [movement pushing for this change]( https://www.brookings.edu/blog/how-we-rise/2021/06/09/pandemics-and-protests-america-has-experienced-racism-like-this-before/) and to address confronting racist ideologies, creating new programs, promoting education about racism, and identifying and dismantling racial inequalities.
  
- [The "heartbeat" law was signed in Texas](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/2/women-march-across-us-in-support-of-abortion-rights), which bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected in the embryo at around 6 weeks, which is earlier than 85-90% of all abortions are carried out, mainly because most women don't know they're pregnant at that time. Abortion rights advocates and the US Justice Department are challenging the Texas law in state and federal courts, arguing that it violates Roe v Wade.

This image is of Black Lives Matter protesters converging in front of the US capital in the streets. The visual of this huge throng of passionate people in front of the symbolic Capitol building was very powerful to me, as it's a sign of the _drive_ and _motivation_ of the people of the United States to **make a change**.


## Analysis
 
The difference between the mean and median of the data tells me that the distribution of the data is skewed right and has a couple very large values or outliers, as the mean is very sensitive to extreme data values.

The number of protests in Washington does not surprise me -- although many of the counties in Washington vote red (for the Republican Party), the PNW is *very* heavily blue (supporting the Democratic Party), and many of the protests addressed in the data are for stereotypically "liberal" movements that a large proportion of the population in Washington presumably support.

A data quality issue that I notice is that California has the most protests by a rather large margin. I would use this observation to change my analysis by taking into consideration the way California skews the data by its geographical size, try to make the graph be one of relatively normal distribution, and be able to better contextualize the proportion of protests in other states. It is likely that in smaller states like Washington, 1,375 could be a high number of protests, but due to outliers from states like California, it seems like it has a lower amount of protests proportionally.

The change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020 does not surprise me. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, an innocent black man, the Black Lives Matter movement gained momentous support not only globally, but internationally. Over 20 million people in the United States joined in demonstrations from May to late June alone, starting an era of racial reckoning. This movement likely encouraged other movements to kickstart protests of their own or increase their frequency as well.

Two specific policies that have been changed as a result of protests in 2020 include:
1. Seattle City Council [banning](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-city-council-bans-police-use-of-tear-gas-and-chokeholds-as-protests-for-black-lives-continue/#:~:text=Seattle%20City%20Council%20bans%20police%20use%20of%20tear%20gas%20and,protests%20for%20Black%20lives%20continue&text=At%20City%20Hall%2C%20the%20City,badge%20numbers%20with%20mourning%20bands.) police usage of tear gas and chokeholds. During protests in Seattle, police were seen repeatedly using tear gas on large crowds, even peaceful ones, in order to disperse them, putting them in danger for simply expressing their freedom of speech.
2. San Diego police were banned from using [cartoid restraint](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-01/san-diego-police-end-use-carotid-restraint-effective-immediately). The move cuts off blood flow to the brain and makes the person unconscious, but can also lead to death, and after the murder of George Floyd from a similar move, the policy was effective immediately.

Viewing the high_level_table variable paints a picture of an America that many unfortunately refuse to believe exists -- an America that is racially unjust and does not care about its people's civil rights, safety from guns, or the immigrants whose backs the country was built on. It is an America that contradicts everything that it stands for.


## Final Thoughts
Something about the analysis that surprised me was just how many protests went unnoticed by the media simply because of their location and size. Understandably, the media tends to focus on large and dramatic protests, but some protests were in small towns and only had about 15 people -- to me, those are equally as meaningful, as they show genuine passion for the movement they're supporting.

This analysis was not much out of the ordinary, however, it was tricky trying to extrapolate the undercover reason of _why_ something was the way that it is. When working with data that concerns our society, there are many other variables to consider when discerning why a crowd would behave the way that it does.

In terms of the dataset, I wish that I was able to make the data into a website where the user could freely explore and learn about all the variables and combinations of data available. It would also be very cool to be able to give the user the option to visualize the data by selectively choosing variables to make them into histograms or scatterplots.
